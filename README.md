#Welcome to this Shieldhodlers RPG
Inspired with TZPG larping society and larp hobby.
Aim is to learn python3 and refactoring but also have fun writing the story and mechanics.
Game should have concept of characters, players enemies, locations and spells casted from command line like functions with arguments.
##Besides learning python and having fun idea is to have a feed for unsatisfied need of creaativity. With just writing it can be sone very fast.
Idea behind game is to make it have interesting story and complex eecosystem. The choices that player needs to do will test him against cognitive biases, which are another field of my interests as described in book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.
The idea is to teach next generation of players that gameplay and storyline is an important part of game and encourage critical and creative thinking.
Unlike in most rpg games this one is not going to have one currency 'eg' gold. One will need to trade items for items with npc, or resources like gold, coal, other collectibles.
Game should have as least pre-defined constraints as possible. For ex. proffesions, spells, items even enemies... many of those should be defined in runtime by player when meeting npc and answer questions like for ex: "Who would you like to become?". This valuse should be stored and later used by another npc. Or for example when *Player* is asked 'what creature are you most afraid of', the answer should be added to list of possible enemies.
